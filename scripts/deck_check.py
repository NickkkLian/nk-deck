"""deck_check.py — the rules a deck from this skill has to keep, checked on the file itself.

    python3 deck_check.py <deck.html> [<deck.html> ...] [--single]
    python3 deck_check.py --selftest

  D01  the deck data block is there, parses, and the page reads its slides from it
  D02  3 to 20 slides, and the first one is the cover
  D03  every title states something: not a label ("Results", "Summary of key findings"), at least three words,
       no trailing colon — a reader who reads only the titles should get the argument         (invariant 1)
       A title in Chinese or Japanese is measured in characters (four at least); the label words are English.
  D04  five points at most on any slide, each under 140 characters                               (invariant 2)
  D05  a point that measures something carries a source — digits, or English number words used as a ratio, a
       rate, a change, a fraction or a size ("four of the last six", "twice as", "doubled", "two thirds",
       "dozens of"); a date, a time or a year is not a measurement, where it cannot also be a count. A deck
       marked illustrative says so in words on the page — markup text or a string the script shows, not a
       comment, attribute or name — and a source it gives a made-up number says "illustrative" too  (invariant 3)
  D06  printing is the deck: an @page of 1280×720 with no margin, every slide one page high with overflow
       hidden and a page break after it, every width media query scoped to screen (a phone layout that reaches
       the print shrinks the type and the margins and keeps the page count, so no page count shows it), and
       print rules that set only page breaks, what shows, colours, and the template's slide frame — nothing
       that moves or resizes what is on a slide — so what ?check=1 measures on screen is what prints
                                                                                                  (invariant 4)
  D07  it works from the keyboard: arrows, space, PageUp/PageDown, Home/End, P to print, and #n opens slide n
                                                                                                  (invariant 5)
  D08  nothing is fetched when it opens, except the fonts the token file names — src/href in either quote, CSS
       url() and @import                                                                          (invariant 5)
  D09  colours come from the token file, not from raw hex in the deck's own styles
  D10  a deck built for delivery is one file: no external stylesheet or script
  D11  no "thank you" slide: the last slide is the decision or the ask

What it cannot see: whether a title is true, whether the argument holds, whether a slide's text actually fits —
`print_check.py` prints the file in Chrome and counts pages for that. D03 and D05 are heuristics that read
English; references/invariants.md lists what they get wrong. Exit 0 clean · 1 findings · 2 selftest failed.
